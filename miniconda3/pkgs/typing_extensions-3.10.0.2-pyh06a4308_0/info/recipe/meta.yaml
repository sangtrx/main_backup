about:
  description: 'The typing module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5
    on a

    provisional basis and will no longer be provisional in Python 3.7. However,

    this means users of Python 3.5 - 3.6 who are unable to upgrade will not be

    able to take advantage of new types added to the typing module, such as

    typing.Text or typing.Coroutine.


    The typing_extensions module contains both backports of these changes

    as well as experimental types that will eventually be added to the typing

    module, such as Protocol.


    Users of other Python versions should continue to install and use the

    typing module from PyPi instead of using this one unless specifically

    writing code that must be compatible with multiple Python versions or

    requires experimental types.
